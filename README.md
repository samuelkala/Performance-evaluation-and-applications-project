# Performance-evaluation-and-applications-project
Final project for the course "Performance evaluation and applications"- Politecnico di Milano - A.A. 2022-2023

The project was done in three different ways. The first way was to employ two MATLAB scripts, contained in the "MATLAB_solution" folder. The other two solutions were obtained employing the modules JMVA and JSIMgraph of the Java Modelling Tools (JMT). These solutions are in the folder "JMT_solution". In order to open the files in this folder the JMT software is necesessary (available here: https://jmt.sourceforge.net/). Finally the folder "Traces" contains the runtime of execution of the stages (in milliseconds).
